    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Every year, millions of hardworking migrants leave their hometowns and travel across India to earn a living. But when it comes to healthcare, they face a major challenge—their medical history doesn’t travel with them. At a new hospital, they are asked to repeat tests, explain their past treatments, and spend extra money and time. This not only causes stress but also puts their health at risk.That’s where the Digital Health Passport for Migrants comes in. Our solution is simple yet powerful—it gives every migrant a secure, digital space to store their health records. From vaccination details to prescriptions and test reports, everything is saved safely and can be accessed anytime, anywhere.Each migrant will receive a unique Health ID with a QR code. All they need to do is register once with their Aadhaar or phone number. After that, whenever they visit a doctor, the QR code can be scanned to instantly pull up their medical history. This makes treatment faster, avoids unnecessary duplicate tests, and ensures continuity of care.
    We have designed this platform to be easy and inclusive. It works in multiple Indian languages so migrants feel comfortable using it. It even has an offline mode for areas with poor internet connectivity. And because health data is sensitive, everything is encrypted and secure, with access given only to authorized doctors and hospitals.Our vision is simple—no migrant should ever be denied proper healthcare just because their records are missing. With the Digital Health Passport, we can make healthcare affordable, accessible, and seamless for millions of workers and their families. This is more than just an app—it’s a step towards giving migrants health freedom and building a healthier, more inclusive India.
